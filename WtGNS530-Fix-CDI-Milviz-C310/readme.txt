This package allows running the Milviz Cessna 310 aircraft with the GTN750/650 in WTT mode.

WTT mode stands for Working Title Technology. This is a software layer that completely replaces
the stock sim autopilot and GPS management. it provides many features not available with the
stock modules. The Working Title Technology is the same as the one used in the WT G1000 Nxi Mod.

Installing this package forces the use of the GTN750 in the aircraft. If your aircraft allows
switching to other GPSs, they will not be functional.
If you don't want to fly with the GTN750 in WTT mode, remove this Mod from your community folder.

This package comes with a more realistic KAP140 autopilot.

- Correct display of lateral and vertical active and armed modes.
- Auto arming to target altitude when engaging AP mode (when pressing the AP button).
- Arming button works (manual arming)
- HDG to NAV arming mode
- UP/DN buttons in ALT mode allows adjusting the managed altitude (+-20feets)
- Baro sync with the main altimeter.
- GS armed for both ILS and RNAV

This package also comes with a modified G5 that fixes the CRS setting issue and avoid switching
to VLOC automatically (this is managed by the WT autopilot manager).
